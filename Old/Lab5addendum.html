<h1>Lab 5 - Ultrasonic addendum</h1>
<p>
The link for the ultrasonic sensor appears to be down. Ostensibly, you could just go
<a href="https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/hc-sr04-ultrasonic-range-finder-osepp.html">here</a> instead.
Also, <a href="https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/hc-sr04-ultra01-ultrasonic-range-finder.html">this</a>
one appears to be virtually identical.
</p>
<p>And, by all means, feel free to check them out. There might be some interesting reading.</p>
<p>However, that isn't where I'd suggest getting the ultrasonic software from. The Arduino IDE has what looks
to be the best option now.</p>
<p><i>Disclaimer: If you're in the second lab of the week, you might be able to skip this step.</i></p>
<p>
In the Arduino IDE, click <em>Tools</em>, then <em>Manage libraries...</em>. In the window that pops up,
type <em>ultrasonic</em> into the search. If you scroll down, there are a few options, but the one by
<b>Gamgine</b> appears to work quite well. (It'll stand out, because there's also a version drop-down
for it)
</p>
<p>
Anyhoo, install that (if it isn't already), and under the <em>File</em> menu, for <em>Examples</em>,
if you scroll down enough (you'll probably have to hover the cursor at the bottom), you should see
a very basic rangefinding example.
</p>
<p>
You don't <em>have</em> to do things this way. It just appears to be the simplest.
