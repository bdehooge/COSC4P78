Besides the included lab, just a couple notes:

<ul>
	<li>Make sure you're <em>very</em> careful connecting the voltage regulator (7805). You're less 
likely to make a mistake if you learn how it works before you solder it in</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Quick version: The ground pin is shared by both the 9V and the board's supply. The 
other two pins go only to one or the other</il>
	</ul>
	<li>You might want to create a +5V and GND rail on each side of the board. You will <em>not</em> 
need 9V anywhere other than to the 7805, so don't put that on a rail</li>
	<li>Because we aren't programming them just yet, just ignore any FTDI programmer (though you should 
probably still add the connections)</li>
	<li>Basically, learn why you're doing what you're doing before you do what you're doing (simple, 
right?)</li>
</ul>
